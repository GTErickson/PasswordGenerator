# PasswordGenerator
Console-based password generator. I used this project to learn the basics of Java!

The application generates secure, customizable passwords and evaluates their strength. Users can specify their desired password length (minimum 4 characters) and choose which character types to include from four available pools:
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Symbols (!@#$%^&* etc.)
### Key Features:
- Interactive command-line interface
- Password strength assessment
- Guaranteed inclusion of selected character types
- Input validation to ensure secure passwords

Perfect for generating strong passwords for your accounts while maintaining control over character requirements!

Happy password generating!
